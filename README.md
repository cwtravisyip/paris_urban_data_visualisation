# Paris Urban Data Visualization
The majority of the data used for visualization are sourced from [Atelier D'Urbanism Parisienne](https://www.apur.org/en/geo-data) through its API. This project relies on the geoPandas package for the manipulation of geospatial data. Contextly was also used for creating base maps. \
The data collection is a group effort. However, data points for certain indicators have no documentation and the sources are not provided. 

Our research shows that the majority of the population resides within the 20 arrondissment of the city of Paris.Yet, 78% of the building stocks are built before 1974, with some dated back in 1851. In particular, a lot of the buildings were constructed during the Hausseman Renovation. Although the Hausseman style is perhaps the allure that attracts tourists into the city, their deisgn had little consideration of energy efficiency.
