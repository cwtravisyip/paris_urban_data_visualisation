# Paris Urban Data Visualization
The majority of the data used for visualization are sourced from [Atelier D'Urbanism Parisienne](https://www.apur.org/en/geo-data) through its API. This project relies on the geoPandas package for the manipulation of geospatial data. Contextly was also used for creating base maps. \
The data collection is a group effort. However, data points for certain indicators have no documentation and the sources are not provided.
