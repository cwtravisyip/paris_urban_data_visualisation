# Paris Urban Data Visualization
The majority of the data used for visualization are sourced from Artelier D'Urbanism Parisienne through its API. This project relies on the geoPandas package for the manipulation of geospatial data. Contextly was also used for creating base maps.
The data collection is a group effort. However, data points for certain indicators have no documentation and the sources are not provided.
